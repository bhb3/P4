                    Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. Billions of people tune in to watch their favorite teams and players compete against each other for trophies. There is a constant debate among fans over which player is the best of all time. These fans support players based on the player's goalscoring, his ability to control the game, or the flashy skills he uses to entertain the fans.
